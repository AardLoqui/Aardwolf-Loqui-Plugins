This is my understanding of the the Titan Goal, a few details
may be missing.
Landion.

Group size 5
The group needs a set of 3 sigils to start the goal:
Sigil of Stealth,
Sigil of Might,
Sigil of Magic.

Obtained by pupping L3.

Go to Salkin and nod Salkin to start goal (only group leader should 
nod)

There are 8 bosses:
Durthar,
Rograg,
Lugthurg, 
Grakkr,
Morgak,
Gjaka,
Orzbuk,
and Hej.

You need to defeat 3 to complete the goal.

If you die during a run you can't return until the boss has been
defeated. Return to salkin and wait.
Run leader will tell you when to nod salkin, you must return before
the reward is handed over.

Dispel sanc on bosses when they quaffs sanc.
Reversing bosses is a good plan.

1) Durthar
100 room move maze, you just need to find him and kill him.
Place a pet in a room next to him and inform the rest of the group.

He transports around the area (no hunt)

If you're attacked by tendril retreat.

He heals when not being attacked.

2) Rograg(hearts)

One person says yes or nods and goes to tank the boss solo.

Group members go to each guardian mob and kill it to
reveal the colour of the altar.

Red altar damages boss.
White heals tank.
Not sure about the other colours.

Push titan from center room to altar, then keep killing it.
Type sac heart to sacrifice heart, repeat.

3) Lugthurg

Keep hps up and blast.

4) Grakkr

Damage type keeps changing, change weapon/spell as required,
You will need 6 weapon types.

Weapons with a suitable damage type can be obtained for L3, easy to get.
Pierce | Air | Elec] - dynamo
Negative | Fire | Light - despair
Water | Slash | Sonic -  render
Cold | Acid | Bash - corroder
Holy | Shadow | Mental- gloom
Magic | Energy | Earth - spirit

5) Morgak

Follow self.

Exploding runes.

 9 rooms, Morgak in center room.

When you see the message 'A powerful magical aura grows around Morgak'
runes will appear in some of the rooms. These runes explode after a set 
period of time. You must find a safe room before they explode.

When you see the mesage update the map and look in the room you're in, if 
you don't see a rune then stay.

If you do see a rune then look for the green ! in the other rooms.
Run to room without a green ! and wait. 
Return to center room when you see the explosions.
Don't heal in the side rooms after the explosion. Morgak could have
dropped more runes, moving back into the center room with a rune (green !) 
will set it off and damage everybody.

If you don't see the green ! in the rooms, you will need to look in each room
in order to find a safe room.
Look for 'A rune lies on the floor glowing faintly'

It's a good idea to add a trigger to update the map when you see the message 

'A powerful magical aura grows around Morgak'

And to speed up checking the runes when you don't see the green !.

'A rune lies on the floor glowing faintly'


6) Gjaka

Reduce hps to <20k.
Do this by either by fleeing or turning off autoassist and running east.


7) Orzbuk

The 4 body parts need to be killed, once one has been killed you have a
limited time to kill the other 3.

Orzbuk's right leg
Orzbuk's left leg
Orzbuk's right arm
Orzbuk's left arm

Aim at each one in turn, to check health.

You receive a restore when all their hps fall below 90%, again at 80% and so
on.

8) Hej

 3 body parts 

Need to be kept apart by using web, once one has been killed you have a
limited time to kill the other 2.

If they join together report stack,  flee and find an anomaly.
Give anomaly to one of the hej to split (report split).

Report to group the health of hej you're fighting.

**************************************************
When a boss is defeated one member of the group will receive
an item (eg Gjaka's Burden).

This item needs to be given to Salkin. Once this had been done
you can move on to the next boss.
Ensure any group member that died has returned before handing over the
item.

After 3 bosses have been defeated you will receive Salkin's Reward,
and possibly a Soul Fragment.
These items need to be give to the man in the start room in order
receive your reward.

If you receive  fragment of the Great Rift portal be sure to wear it
or keep it in your inventory (suggest not in a bag).
(If you don't you'll never receive greaves)

If you receive 'Soul of a Dying Star' (must have portal to receive) give 
this back to the man.

Reply 'say destroy worlds'
You will receive rank 1 greaves

The second time you receive a Soul of a Dying Star give it back to man, 
followed by rank1 greaves. DON'T say destroy worlds a 2nd time.

You'll receive the next rank.

****************************************************

If you receive a Fractal Rune this can be used to add a resist to
an item (only once per item)

In order to do this you need to collect 20 essence items, random drops
for Titan L3.

Essence of Acid
Essence of Holiness
Essence of Light
Essence of Piercing
Essence of Disease
Essence of Sound
Essence of Shadow
Essence of Coldness
Essence of Negativity
Essence of Bashing
Essence of Slashing
Essence of Water
Essence of Electricity
Essence of Energy
Essence of Magic
Essence of Earth
Essence of Fire
Essence of Air
Essence of Poison
Essence of the Mind*

Collecting these if you don't have the uncurse wish is very hard work.

*If you find an essence of mind you should give it to Landion:P

These items must be taken to The Star Forge - on 2nd level of titan.

type 'forge essence'

You'll receive Essence of Resistance (saves a lot of space)

If you have a Fractal Rune type 'forge rune essence'

You'll receive a fractal rune.

This rune can be used to add resistance to and item.
