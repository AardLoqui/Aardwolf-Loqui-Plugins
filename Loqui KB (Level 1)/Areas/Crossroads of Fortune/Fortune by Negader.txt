Lord Durkin raises his eyes to you with great effort and gives you an
evaluating stare.

Lord Durkin says, "I am unable to go on, traveler. I am overwhelmed with
the choices before me, and filled with guilt over choices long past."

Lord Durkin sighs.

Lord Durkin says, "I have heard tales of a wise magician that may be able to
provide some guidance, and perhaps can help me find peace.  Would you act
as my messenger and seek out this magician?"

>say yes
You say 'yes'
Lord Durkin says, "Thank you, traveler. If you can assist me, your help
will not go unrewarded. First, I will tell you what little I know:

People talk of a wise man that can be found in these lands; a man with
great and unimaginable powers of magic. It is said that if you seek him out,
he can divine knowledge and provide guidance to those with troubled
thoughts. I do not truly know if he can help me, but I believe he is the
only one who can.

Seek out this man on my behalf, promise him any renumeration he requires
in my name, and return anything you learn from him to me."

The red magician says, "Greetings! So, this Lord Durkin requires my
assistance, does he? Well, you've come to the right place, but not at the
right time. I recently used the last of the herbal ingredients I require
to divine such information. As such, I am unable to help."

The old magician frowns thoughtfully, tapping one of his fingers
rhythmically against his cheek...

The red magician says, "Wait... If you are willing to see this through, then
I can assist you. Collect samples of herbs and plants from each of the four
seasons and return them to me. With these, I will perform a reading for this
Lord Durkin. Once you're done just come back and tell me so."

The red magician looks at you in surprise, then says, "Excellent. You have
collected the ingredients I require. As promised, I will divine the
knowledge you seek... but here is where things get difficult:

"I will draw 3 cards from this enchanted deck. Each has a spiritual
representation in this realm. I will give each of the cards to you - you
must locate these spritual representations and draw them in. Once you have
done this, return to me, and the information can be taken to Lord Durkin."

The magician sits unceremoniously on the ground and sets out four small
crucibles in a pattern arranged to the north, south, east, and west. In
each, he places a small amount of the collected herbs, a small amount of
some kind of clear, viscous liquid, then sets a spark to each. The
contents of each crucible starts to burn with a slow, steady flame.

With bowed head and a reverent pause after each, he draws 3 cards from the
deck. He does not reveal them, but hands them directly to you.

** Task Added : The Empress
** Task Added : The Star
** Task Added : The Lovers

The red magician says, "Go now. Hopefully when you find the spirit of each
card, you will be wise enough figure out what to do next. Once you have
collected all three, return to me."

>pick flower

The empress rises from her cushions and regards you with a cool stare. After a
moment, she speaks, "I could have you executed for that, traveler. Those
flowers are royal property."
Her mouth turns into a sudden smirk, then she continues, "Retrieve for me a
peach, that I may sate my hunger, and I will forgive you."
After a moment, she turns and returns to her cushions in the manner of a
satisfied feline.

With a few hand gestures, she signals you to undress and enter the pool, then
turns her back to you and once again faces the stars.

You enter the pool and are immediately filled with an immense feeling of hope
and well-being. You soak under the light of the stars for a few minutes until
the cold water jolts you back to a more lucid state. You exit the pond and don
your armor in silence, afraid to interrupt the serenity around you.

"Spectacular, traveler. You have indeed collected the spirits I require. Please
give me a moment to perform the reading.
The red magician holds his hands up and starts to chant rhythmically.

You feel a slight tingle, and realize the spirits you collected are being
drained from your body. The chanting continues.
The magician frowns, but continues chanting...
The red magician says, "This is unfortunate, traveler. It appears that there are greater forces at work than I had expected. This reading is beyond my ability."
The red magician says, "All is not lost, however. I can send you to someone who has greater power than I possess. If you are prepared, simply nod when you are ready."

The gardener pauses for a moment, wipes his brow, then speaks, "Good day to
you, traveler.  As you can see, I'm a bit busy. Unfortunately, not as busy as
I'd like to be. I was preparing to plant a very rare acorn that was to be
delivered by a dear old soldier friend of mine. Unfortunately, his troops saw
a very rough battle, and I'm afraid he may have fallen. It is very unfortunate
indeed. I don't suppose there is anything you can do to help, is there?"

voice, "Greetings, traveler. I apologize for the disarray of my household. Our
youngest has been extremely energetic lately, and I admit, I have not kept up
as well as I would have hoped."
After a brief pause, she continues, "Could you help me, traveler? I have

something that will make dealing with the little one a bit easier. Can you

   I have sent soldiers to face him, but each has fallen and been raised as a

He finishes his little dance, then turns to you with a predatory glint in his
eyes. "Now comes the fun part! These spirits aren't nearly enough for what we
need to get Lord Durkin's reading done. There has been far too much meddling.
It's time to get serious."

"His smile turns cold before continuing, "Certain forces have been at work that
have damaged a number of the spirits. They've been broken into pieces and must
be put back together. I've got the glue if you've got the time, traveler. Those
opposing forces keep me from interfering, but they can do nothing if I send you
in... well, maybe they can kill you, but that's beside the point. If you're
ready for a bit of a challenge, just let me know."
** Task Added : Droll has a tougher job...

>say ready

You say 'ready'
Droll takes a breath as if drawing strength from the air around him. "Okay,
traveler. It's time to get serious. Deadly serious. I'm going to draw 3 cards
from my deck. You simply need to dispatch the creatures that have absorbed the
fragments of each of those cards' spirits. Simple enough? There will be plenty
of other nasty creatures trying to slow you down. Don't die."

(R) A man hangs upside-down from what looks like a trapeze.
(G) A lost puppy is whimpering softly as it makes its way through the debris.
Droll greets you with a heartwarming smile, "It is a fine day, is it not,
traveler? I believe it is the day we will complete that pesky reading, and
perhaps I can have a little peace. You've done me a little favor, got rid of
some pests for me, and I'll owe you one for this."

With a flourish, Droll takes a small scroll that appears to be blank from his
pocket. He rolls it up with a flick of his wrist, then touches one end to his
forehead. A small spark seems to jump from his skin to the parchment of the
scroll, then he puts it in your hands. "Make haste, traveler. I will send you
back to where this must be delivered. Lord Durkin will be expecting you."

Using familiar gestures, Droll holds his hands aloft, raises his eyes skyward,
and begins to chant.

** Task Done  : Return to Droll Nikrud with the collected fragments

[Innocence]

Lord Durkin asks, "I have waited long, traveler. What word do you bring?"
Lord Durkin takes the scroll from you, and reads it carefully.
Lord Durkin turns away from the scroll. "Traveler, thank you. I will need to
study this in detail, as you might expect. I believe this information will
provide me the guidance I need, but it is not straighforward.

"There is also information for you, traveler. The scroll contains magical power
that is able to transport you to Droll's reversed realm. Simply come to me and
say 'reverse' any time you desire this.

"The last bit of information is a reading for you, traveler. I will make a copy
for you."

He continues, "The scroll also details that it has the power to provide future
readings as situations change in life. This power can be called upon one time
per week. You can return to me and ask for a reading - if the scroll has
enough power, I will copy it down for you again."

He smiles fondly, "For your help with this, I would like you to have one final
gift. Please take this card. It has been with me for a long time, but I think
it has outlived its usefulness."
