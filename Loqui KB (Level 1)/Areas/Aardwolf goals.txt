Diamond Reach Treasury
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Creator has the added function of holding all donations collected for Mallic's research. This gold generally can not be regained by players and will 

vanish with a reboot. Some advantages are unlocked as the value increases.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Total
Value  Unlocked Feature(s)
-----  ------------------------------------------------------------
1B     Mallic will have the guts to attempt creating a new savable portal for anyone who has the goals completed. This self-destructs the treasury back to 

1-100 mil.

500M   Portal Destination for nudging is a guaranteed ruins-48.
  
250M   All diamonds loaded will be rare diamonds. Keep in mind that this drains gold from this treasury which has been collected from the player base!
  
100M   Portal Destination for nudging is tightened, increasing the chance of hitting ruins-48.
  
70M    Neutralizer Enhancement Maxed. (Up to all 3 enchant flags set.)

60M    Neutralizer Enhancement Strengthened. (Up to 2 enchant flags set)

50M    Neutralizer Shard can be enhanced. Enhancement allows cutting through to the good present regardless of treasury value. (tests a worn shard for 

rotdeath flag)(100k for toggle)
  
30M    Room-34 now a viable portal destination. (Second Crystal Room)
  
15M    Neutralizer Shard can cut through the bad present, allowing direct teleportation to the good future.(If goal complete and neutralizer worn.)

Note: ruins-47, ruins-43, ruins-34, ruins-18 are by default not possible for tweaked portal destinations. Otherwise the default range is rooms 1-48.
 
As you can see from the list, it gets harder to actually increase the treasury to maximum after a point. Most diamonds created for those doing the diamond 

quest will actually drain about 60k gold from the treasury to "upgrade" a common 10k diamond into a 30k diamond. And after the 500M mark there's little 

incentive for players to keep pushing it towards the maximum 1B mark with repeated tweaking.

This is intended, as most of the useful tweaks open up in the first 100M or so, usually by people tweaking their portals and later enhancing neutralizers if 

they want to. 
 
Anyone who REALLY wants a bonus portal is likely going to have to pony up a lot of cash on their own, and as soon as they get it, they'll have to build up 

another 900M to repeat it. (This will keep it rare. Or drive Aardwolf veterans broke - and then keep it rare.)

evil.
 2. If you get no response at all in the Experiment Room, move around and find other experimenting wizards and say 'prisoner' to them.  The wizards all tend 

to wander, so they may or may not be in the Experiment Room.
 3. If all else fails, kill ALL of the experimenting wizards and wait for repop in the Experimenting Room.  For whatever reason, their progs like to mess up 

from time to time and killing them all off should reset them.

'normal' guy with no cskill to change align in Salin's room.

Ft2          Reach the Seelie Courts in Faerie Tales II.     140      4 
Some important notes before you get started:

This goal is locked above 155, so 155 is the last level you can attempt this goal. Above which, you won't even be able to access sections such as Jack and 

the beanstalk and under the sea. You'll also need to have the skills dagger, sword, spear, staves (preferably at 100%), blind, envenom. Major creation will 

be very helpful too.

You'll need to get the following items to complete certain tasks in the goal, a simpler alternative is to use major creation:

- Change sex potions. There are pills for sale in Solan called "rutabaga" (4th item in the shop), buy 50 of these.
- Any 'dagger' type weapon. You can buy an Aylorian dirk at Xena in Aylor.
- Any 'sword' type weapon. You can buy this at Xena too.
- A Griffon's Blood. You can get this at Alchemy Supplies in Aylor.
- Any item with the keyword 'wish'.
  silver fish (Faerie Tales 1) - your first wish 
- Any item with the keyword 'head'.
  Goblin (Realm of Deneria) - goblin head
  a group of kobolds (Realm of Deneria) - kobold head
  an orc (Realm of Deneria) - orc head
- Any item with the keyword 'heart'.
  Amethyst Dragon(Realm of Deneria) - Crystal Heart
- Any item with the keyword 'lute'.
  a musician (The Eighteenth Dynasty) - a lute
- Any item with the keyword 'chocolate'.
  Josephine (The Three Pillars of Diatz) - a slice of German chocolate cake

     Alignment issues: There are various points in the goal where you have to wear eq that have anti-neutral or anti-good flags. The last task also require 

you to be sufficiently good-aligned. My advice is to let your alignment hover around 800-950 so it's easy to kill a good/evil mob to switch between neutral 

and good when necessary.

     Other notes: A lot of bugs have been rectified since the initial addition of the goal. However, some persist. A general tip is to make sure no other 

mobs or players are in the room when you require a mprog to be fired or while giving key items to the mob. Also, if mobs don't react, try moving in and out 

of the room and hope for the best. In the situation where the weasel does not give you the next task when you give it the required item, you'll have to redo 

from Task 1.

Inferno      Hero, have you heard the legend of the Inferno? 201      4 

Inferno
---------------------------
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Inferno is extant!  Recent reports have been heard across the land, confirming the opening of another gateway to the land of ancient power. A withered 

storyteller has been seen wandering Aylor, telling any who will listen about this mystic land.

All sources agree - power is to be had if the realm could be tamed by a group of powerful adventurers.  Will you brave the Inferno?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Difficulty       : Very Hard          
Recommended Level: 201
Minimum Level    : 200
Maximum Level    : 201
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Journey To The Inferno is an Epic area created by Quadrapus that loosely follows Dante's Inferno from the Divine Comedy. The area requires quite a large 

group for alot of it. Unless I state otherwise consider all of this needing 20 plus.

1. At Alai type 'ask' to open the goal and to recieve the first two tasks.

2. First thing to do is to clear the room two east of Alai and then south of that room, Once these are clear the entire party will go back north and type 

'stare spire'.

3. Once the whole party is in here, the group holder will attempt to go noth, after a brief wait the entire party will be sent to the crypts.

4. Someone who is organizing needs to go east and south and look rune and make note of shape and color.

5. Once all are in, the group holder will move the party east and north, in this room is a shade. Make sure everyone understands they need to be fast and 

then  the entire party(or those who need Medallions) will 'greet shade' for an
Ash-Covered Medallion, wear them immediately and don't remove it.

6. Now all will be back on the bridge, and possibly kicked out, do not worry the bridge will reopen. This is how the bridge has to be approached. The group 

has to manually move together across the bridge, so if the lead tank goes east all
of the group has to manually go east. You need to clear the mobs from the rooms east and south, try to make sure the group clears all of them.

7. Once on the other side, clear the rooms there and then its time to challenge Charon. Charon will call waves of mobs so make sure to have group aim off of 

Charon and kill the mobs as they come. Once Charon dies he will leave a lantern
on the ground, make sure someone picks it up.

8. Now give the Lantern to someone with over 551 Int and Wis, they will id the Lantern and report the shape and color of the Rune, then give it back to the 

organizer.

9. Two north from where Charon died is the room to drop the Lantern. The Lantern is melt drop so make sure you are in the right room. The desc will mention 

a place to put a Lantern. Once you drop it, the door down from Charon will open
and now if 3 or more wait at Alai he will transport you across the bridge.

10. Now for the Battlefield, down from Charon is a bat, at this bat the main tanks will manually move south and call for party to join, once you manually go 

south Task 3 will open. Now to clear the battlefield. The first crucial part in this
is the fact you have to have a Medallion and be wearing it to participate here. If not, the Sentries will call alot of Orc Troopers which are a pain and 

will kill alot of the group. First thing is first, clear the room with the spring. Someone with over 551 Int and Con will 'drink spring' and report the 

shape and color to the organizer. From here the group will move to clear all the rooms without the demonlords. The Demonlords are swsw from south of bat, 

swswsw from south of bat, se from south of bat, sese from south of bat, and 5s from south of bat.(Also ignore the room right next to the 5s one) Once all 

those rooms are clear we can begin on the Demonlords.

11. Minos is located swsw from south of the bat, during this fight he may randomly throw people around which is why it was crucial to clear the mobs, if you 

land in a room with mobs word of recall out asap. Other than that, Minos is the
easiest of the Demonlords, once he is dead, head to the room with the rubble blocking east and up.

12. Once there, clear up, then the three west rooms, then the two up rooms to clear some of the archers. Now back to the bottom and clear out the east and 

two north rooms. Once clear, the organizer will 'look barrel' and make note of the shape and color of the Rune.

13. Now for Plutos, before anything, you must organize two tanks to first hold Plutos' room then to have another tank go east of him, then whole party will 

clear that room. Once it is clear we are ready for Plutos.

14. Now Plutos is to be treated like Asverien in OC. He will call three different waves of mobs. His room is no quaff so healers will have to go east and 

quaff. It is crucial to not dispel Plutos and when the wave of mobs come that all aim off Plutos and kill the mobs, to do this you will have to retreat east 

and come back. More importantly is that Plutos will eat someone randomly. If you are eaten do not panic, it is up to you to 'look rune' and report to 

organizer the shape and color for the Rune. Also do not touch anything in there as 'touch rune' will reset and require us to kill Minos again. Once the 

three waves are done, you can dispel Plutos and kill him.

15. Now it is time for Geryon, she is located se of south of the bat. The first thing to do is to clear the mobs around him and then have the party retreat 

west and Geryon reheal to 100%. Now the key to Geryon is time, she must be defeated in under three minutes. She is immune to acid, air, cold, earth, energy, 

fire, light, electric, mental, shadow, sonic, and water, so make sure you have the proper weapons on. Also dispel her quick, if the party is strong enough 

you should clear her out.

16. Now it's time to kill Malebranche. He is located five south of the bat, there isn't much to him except you cannot flee or retreat from him. If you 

managed Plutos then this is a piece of cake.

17. Now to head to the room with the rubble blocking west. Clear out the last of the archers in the parts to the west and the two barrel rooms. In the room 

with the second barrel organizer will 'look rune' and make note of the shape and color.
18. Now we are ready for Nimrod he is located 2sese from south of the bat. He also like Plutos must be approached like Asverien, Nimrod has four waves and 

the special thing here is to not quaff or recite in his room or else he will massively blind everyone. As before it is crucial to make sure noone dispels 

Nimrod and aims off of him and kills the wave of mobs before the next wave, this is especially important for wave three and four as fourth comes soon after 

the third. Once all four waves are done, dispel and finish off Nimrod. The person landing the killing blow will get Enlightenment, give this to the 

organizer.

19. Now the group holder will lead the group to the gargoyals by where Malebranche was. Make sure to pick up anyone who died first via the Alai transfer. 

Once everyone is at the Gargoyal the organizer will give the Enlightenment to the
Gargoyal and the group holder will enter the gateway and Task 3 will close and Task 4 will open. Now time for the Great Hall. Everyone can take turns 

exploring the up room and all of the Great Hall rooms. But do not touch anything in the up
room. Also at this time Alai will begin to now send three or more directly to the Great Hall.

20. Now once everyone is ready to solve the Great Hall puzzle, the lowest hp/tier person will go up and will become the controller. Each room has a Rune you 

can see by 'look rune' it is crucial to find the six Runes from privious parts. Once
you do you must plan the route for the orbs. Keep in mind a red orb can not cross a room a blue orb is already in or it will create a Supernova mob. Now it 

is important to make sure autoass is off and if anyone at anytime is fighting an orb to have them flee off asap. When ready and the plan is known the 

controller will touch the red of blue crystal. The way this works is the opposite color orb must be placed on one of the six Runes, in doing this you will 

have to decide which rooms to be cleared of mobs to make it easier for someone with no weapons on to push the orbs into the correct rooms, this can be done 

without having to clear out alot of the rooms. Once all six are placed, the controller will touch the green crystal and an explosion will shoot the party 

two north of center and all mobs will disappear. Keep in mind that at random times the green crystal will break before all orbs can be placed. If this 

happens wait for two minutes and a message will let you know that the mobs have disappeared. Just start over from begining of orb puzzle.

21. Once the orb puzzle is done the down door will be open, inside is a noquaff, nomagic room with a Guardian. The key to this is to establish some "up 

healers" just like Asverien and a tank rotation. Those hitting will need to go up and
say "heal" for the healers to heal them, make sure the tank gets to come up too at times. If this is done right the Guardian will die, which will open an 

archway south, east, and east from the center, the group holder will take the
party there and enter the archway. Now Alai will begin to send people directly to the underground river.

22. Next part requires everyone to gather at the well, from here the party will go west and meet Artisural, The Skeleton Lord. He will give you the rules of 

the next part. If you forget you can 'bow artisural' to see them again. Now this part
will require alot of organization. As the goal here is to hold the center, south, north, up, and down rooms. Now this becomes more tricky thanks to the fact 

that the north room is noquaff, and the south room is noquaff and nomagic. The key here is to divide up the group with two tanks per room, and as many 

healers as possible with keeping in mind an extra tank for south and extra healers for south and north to make up for having to move to heal and quaff. Once 

ready you must count down and have the tanks move first to their assigned rooms and once the test begins the healers will go to their assigned rooms and 

heal. The goal is to keep at least one person in all 5 rooms at all times, if one room empties you will be rewarded with another explorable room and like 

twenty mobs that will kill the whole party. Once you begin the rooms with get 2-3 minor mobs and one boss mob. South room boss is Jacob, North room boss is 

Robert, Down room boss is Emile ,Up room boss is Victor, and Center room boss is Artisural, The Skeleton Lord. Once all rooms are clear the last mob will 

give a key that opens west of center.

23. Now move the group west to the well and enter the well, at this point you will enter a room with a mob named Kaare, Alai will now transport you here. In 

order to close Task 2 and continue you must 'nod Kaare'.

24. This next part again requires proper planning, you have to send 3 "sacrifices" out one each to east, west, and south. Once they go in place healers will 

also go to those rooms where the main tank will move to Death's room. The other t9s who are not a "sacrifice" also move to Death's room. If any of the 

"sacrifices die, stand up, or move, then the whole party will be sent to Aylor. Noone dispels Death as this has to be done Asverien style like Plutos and 

Nimrod. When mobs come everyone must retreat off of Death and come back and rescue one of the wave mobs off. When someone needs healing they will retreat 

out of Death's room and get healed by one of the healers with the "sacrifices". Waves come around 85ish, 75ish, 60ish, 45ish, 25ish, and 15ish. Continue 

with the strategy until Death is dead.

25. Once Death is dead a portal will open and Khrysta will appear and talk to you. Inside the gateway will have a 'helprewards' with this message.

A loud voice fills your head:

Congratulations on making it this far, adventurer.
You will be rewarded for traveling this close to the Inferno.
You will be given a reminder of your journey here. Each subsequent journey will change the markings on that stone. Do not attempt to alter those markings by 

any means - you will lose what you have attained.

There are five ranks to climb here. Each has special rewards and advantages. Higher ranks also give rank rewards more frequently than lower ones.

Some objects here have magical properties that can only be ascertained through a spell like identify.

Again, congratulations. Now prepare yourself for the fright of your life.

26. Make sure everyone is ready and wearing medallions and enter gateway, open down and go down and 'bow Burakumin' to finish goal and area. Rewards are 

Random.

Rewards

Everyone gets a Lodestone to mark their progress

(From Death no idea what it is yet)

requires many buckets of fresh blood to make sure her bath goes on as
planned. Nothing suits her more than wriggling around naked in the blood of
the corrupted souls she governs. Will you do all the dirty work and bring her
the blood she needs to fulfill her sick fetish?

Lady Dementia says 'Fine fine, to get out of here quick, go all the way back
up and pray for HOME.'

 Blood Bath
  You have reached the bottom of the hole and find yourself inside some kind of
underground ruin. To your east and west large columned entryways wait for you
to venture between them. You can hear loud grunts and groans coming from
either side. To the south another temple seems to be carved into the red
soaked earth. Then you see it, the reason for the blood, the reason for the
bodies. In the middle of the room directly under the narrow tunnel above is a
bowl dug into the earth and lined in marble and lying in the middle is a
horned woman. She seems to be bathing in the vital fluid of all the poor saps
who have been killed up above.

 cold mortal. Bring me fresh blood to fill it with warm plasma. How you

 you. It should take about 200 buckets."

 4. Get all the equipment: a Dark Hood, Umari's Black Cloak, Black Boots, the Sigul of the Black Flame, an Oak Wand, and Silver Eyeglasses.
 

Umari
---------------------------
To do this goal, I would recommend having at least 40k hps.
You have to kill a pretty tough mob that loves to dispels +
you and heal himself.

To start the goal, first kill Hagami for his key, then
go to the room 7sw2sws2w of the entrance and open north.
walk north and get the piece of paper from the ground.
Take this piece of paper to umari. Give him the paper
and he will remove all his eq and drop it. Get all.
Wear all of the eq except for the silver eyeglasses.
(wearing this eq will also let you past the gargoyles
at the entrance until after you've finished the goal).

Once you have the eq on, go to Hathil. When you enter
the room with him he should hand you layna's hat. Go
to layna and give her the hat, the goal should open.
Now, while still in Layna's room, say yes. Then give
her 20000 gold. This should open the task to find and
defeat Mrrl.

Go to Holly in the kitchen and remove Umari's wand, say
I'm hungry. She should hand you a frying pan. Take
this frying pan back to Layna and give her 20k gold again.
She will take you to the room west of Mrrl. Before
fighting him it would be a good idea to have a lot of
incomplete heals on hand. Mrrl will repeatedly dispel
you and will blind you about every other round. He can
be awed pretty easily, so awe him and respell every now
and then. After killing Mrrl, walk east of him and type
get all. This should close a task and open another.

Take the book you just picked up to Umari. Give him the
book and quickly type get all. Take the statue you picked
up to Layne and give it to her. She will give you a pretty
decent level 200 item that is randomly selected from the
items she has equipped. Goal complete. So far, they don't
appear to be farmable.

You should also have received an owned item from Umari when
you gave him the book. The item will allow you to walk past
the gargoyles without wearing Umari's eq. It tranports you
to Umari when you walk past the gargoyles.

Notes: You need 1 Orb of Power - that does not disappear when you kill Abazel. Each of the other three (Mordiak - Ring of Demonslaying, Nithian - Orb of 

Four Winds, Shichi - Visor of Prophecy) will be purged upon killing Abazel. You want to farm the sets and hide them in bag so only one set is in your 

inventory, so it doesn't purge all of the items.

You can also farm the other items in the later part before hand as well.
