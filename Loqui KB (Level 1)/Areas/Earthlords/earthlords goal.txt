---------------------------------------------------
This goal has two solutions, one where you sabotage the city, and one where you help the city.
At this point, I switched over to the other side and I don't think there is a way back.
---------------------------------------------------

8. Go to "Church of Gaia" (GMCP: 42062) and type worship.

** Task Done : Sabotage of the city.
** Task Added : Feed and cloth the lost.

9. Go back to Jacoby and buy apple and asparagus. Then go to the underground part (by typing "jump down" in any of the rooms named
"Standing Before Earth's Maw") and look for a mob named Rock in the southeast quadrant. Kill Rock for a leather tunic and leather pants.

10. Go back to Linlie's Home and give apple boy, give pants boy, give asparagus girl, give tunic girl.

11. Go back to the Church and listen priest to update the goal.

** Task Done : Feed and cloth the lost.
** Task Added : Remove the Sacred Flame dissidents.

12. Go back to Sha'nel and Le'lani and kill Le'lani and D'kath.

13. Go back to the Church again and say 'they are dead' to update the goal.

** Task Done : Remove the Sacred Flame dissidents.
** Task Added : Gather the items to to create a weapon to challenge Gaia.

The priestess of Gaia says, "To successfully challenge Gaia, you must
gather a wise man's tears, a poor man's smile, winter's heart, and
summer's bloom. Once you have gathered these items, you will need to find
a string of earth and a metal band to bind them into a weapon. Return to
me with the items and we will forge you a weapon."

14. Go to "The Sun Rise Tavern" (GMCP: 42061) on the north side of town and kill Syndny for a Winter's Heart (might not spawn with it every time).

15. Go to "The Doctor's Office" (GMCP: 42098) also on the north side of town and kill a patient for a weak smile (might not spawn with it every time).

16. Go to "Earth Moving Travel Inc." (GMCP: 42052) near the start of the area and type 'get rose'. Then, go to Linlie's Home again,
and give rose linlie to get Summer's Bloom.

17. Go back to the underground part and look for Iron Mike in the southwest quadrant. Kill him for an Iron Ring with Draconic Runes (not 100% drop either).

18. Go to the second house on the west side of town called "An Adobe Home" (GMCP: 42059) and kill a father for Wisdom of Life
(he might not spawn with it every time).

19. In that same room, kill the wife (this took me 4-5 repops because she definitely doesn't spawn with it every time) until you get a stone key.
Once you have that, open west in that room to get to "A Hidden Garden" (GMCP: 42099).

20. In the garden, type 'pick carrot', 'pick tomato', 'pick potato', 'pick lettuce' until you get clumps of earth held together by a string of roots.
Getting the clumps of earth is a % chance, so if you are not successful, you will have to drop all the veggies and do the picking thing again.

21. Now you have all the items, return to the Church and say 'forge weapon'. Then wait until she gives you Earth's Bloom and the goal updates.

** Task Done : Gather the items to create a weapon to challenge Gaia.
** Task Added : Battle Gaia.

22. Wear bloom then head underground again. This time, keep going down to Gaia's room. This room is noquaff,
and the trick is to blind then awe the golems that spawn. Then, dispel Gaia and blast.
If you have problems killing Gaia, you can recall out and come back and try again (he doesn't heal up).

[Qbano: Gaia does heal after a longer period of time. You don't have to blind and awe the golems. For me only 2 golems spawned and
               if you are buff enough you can take it :p. At first I was using a shield and wielding only the Earth's Bloom.
               But after I got Gaia down to 50% my damage was not enough and had to switch to dual. From there it was pretty easy.
               Maybe should have done that from the start... :/
               Also...you can't use scrolls either. Well you can but then Gaia takes 50% of your current HP.
               Gaia says, "You shall fight me fairly or not at all."
               Gaia chants the phrase 'Earthen Tomb'.
               A powerful hand reaches up and pulls you down into the earth, crushing you half to death.]

23. The goal completes when Gaia is dead.

** Task Done : Battle Gaia.
** Goal Completed: Help the Sacred Flame infiltrate and weaken the Earth Lords.
