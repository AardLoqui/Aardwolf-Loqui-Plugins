the prankster.  I could really use your help in my next prank on
Grandmaster Mage Nystaulyk.  You should forge a funny letter with his
handwriting.  I'm sure there is an example of handwriting in his quarters,
but getting there is an different issue.  You will have to get through the
upstairs deadman and into the vault's safe first.  Visit the master
craftsman in the workshop and maybe he can get you started.  I offer you a
warning though:  the guards only allow servants to pass through the
deadman.'

think of that before?  Not only did the blast in Dusk Valley change the
atmosphere and leave a strange glow in the sky, but everything underground
became energized.  Strange things happen underground during different
times of the day.  I'm not a Relyk, but when I came here as a child
there was a nursery rhyme they used to tell us before going to sleep:
 
Into the dark and and into the deep,
where the dragon lurks and creeps.
To read the wall and gain clear sight,
you need not black, or grey, but white.'

Kiden says, 'I should thank you for all of your help but fairly soon
it won't matter.  How could you not see this coming?  I am not who
you think I am.  I am actually a Nightshifter and my position as a
chef was only a cover.  Before Master Mages Fahlen and Fahlyk died
after leaving Dusk Valley they both had sons.  Grandmaster Mage
Nystaulyk is the fifth generation grandson of Fahlyk, and I am the
fith generation grandson of Fahlen.
 


  For centuries the Relyks refused to share their knowledge and power
with my race.  They blamed us for The Great War and the destruction of
Dusk Valley.  My ancestors devoted their lives to the black magicks in
anticipation of a another war.  Once they realized that the Relyks came
from integrating Eldars and Giants,  our Eldars wanted an even more
powerful race so they began integrating with the Shadows to create
Nightshifters.
 

  I was inserted undercover into this mansion when I was still a
child and have become more powerful every day.  My family has been
waiting for me to destroy Nystaulyk and claim Afterglow as a permanent
home for us.  I only had to wait for someone foolish enough to help me
gain the upper hand.  That is where you came in.
 

  You helped me forge a letter in Nystaulyk's handwriting, and that
was meant to distract him while I finished my plan to attack.  You
have collected everything I needed to build a dragon and also gave
me this piece of amber which actually contains a powerful necromancer
spell to give this dragon life.  You have unknowingly brought the
race of Relyks to their knees.
 
  Unfortunately you know too much, so after you are gone I will destroy
Nystaulyk and everyone else in this mansion.'

Kiden utters the words, 'bovalata'.

The amber catches fire and melts to the ground, revealing an ancient scroll.

Kiden recites the scroll and you hear a dragon's roar from the direction
of Kiden's quarters.

Kiden says, 'Because I feel sorry for tricking you, I will give you only
one opportunity to escape your fate.  I want to hear you surrender in
Relyk though:  ' '`',..,,.., ^.-<><>o:`:..o<> }{,,. _,,.>- 

** Task Hint  : Your 'tasks' list has been updated with a new hint.

Kiden says, 'You fool!  You fell for it once again.  I've been wanting to
hear someone surrender to me in the Relyk language for years now.  You
cannot escape your fate my friend.'

'Goodbye Landion.'

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Although the powers of Master Mages Fahlyk and Fahlen were released in
Dusk Valley, the brothers were not completely destroyed.  After regaining
their powers they both conjured a devastating blow.   The amount of energy
was so great nearly everything in the Valley was destroyed and a bright
aura was left in the sky.  The Great War had finally ended but neither
side had won.  The remaining residents of Dusk Valley were forced to
settle elsewhere.  The brother's mutual hatred had not lessened though and
over time they both passed away.  

  Nearly one thousand years after the destruction of Dusk Valley, time
seemed to heal the devastation wrought during the Brothers' war.   Trees
grew tall and strong, streams filled the crevices in the land, grass
covered the valley floor and fauna cautiously populated the region once
more.

  Upon hearing of the rebirth of the Valley, the Relyks returned to the area
to start anew.  Although many centuries had passed the aura covering the
valley remained.  The region became known as Afterglow.  The Relyks in the
area have built a large mansion to honor their master.  Those who have 
contributed to the community are scribed into a great book.  Are you 
honorable enough to contribute to Afterglow?
