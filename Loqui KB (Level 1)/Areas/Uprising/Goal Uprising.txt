Rewards:
 Dark Lady’s blessing
– A level 131 light with good DR, Str and Dex. It’s obtained from
 the repeatable AQ that’s unlocked after the goal.
 .
 A note copy-pasted from ‘help uprising':
 As a warning, starting this goal makes completion of quests and campaigns
 within this area more difficult. Further to this, single class warriors and
 rangers will require assistance from other players if they need to complete
 certain quests or campaigns within this area while working on the goal (if
 they do not yet have access to their level 201 skills).
 .
 The goal involves mobprogs that impede movement withing the area,
 which leads to the situation described above.
 You have been warned.

 run sese2se3s to Twist in the Tunnels.
 The dark elf high priestess should start talking.
 After a while, she will ask you to say yes.

 You can set a trigger to ‘sit’ on the phrase
‘Maybe you should get down low!’,
and ‘stand’ on the phrase
‘The cyclops does not see you, it’s safe to continue!’.
 .
In addition, killing the cyclops stops them from stopping you,
 It makes running through rooms easier (in between repops).

 Also, every time you get thrown out,
 some of your spellup spells will be dispelled.

 Mist form does not work in many parts of Uprising.
 .

 saying that ‘You slip into the troll’s robe’.

 ** Task Added : Rescue the Dark Elves from the Cerejellums
 .
 From Before a Large Room,
 run 3n3e;walk through wall;run 2en2eses;squeeze through
 to An ornate hallway.
 Every time you move a room, you will get attacked.
 Fleeing and retreating do not work.

 to the The Birthing Chambers.
 Upon reaching there, a long mobprog in dark yellow should occur.

 Do this until you have 8 bugs.

 Look for any colossal spider, and ‘bow colossal’
to recieve the cobweb of a colossal spider.
 .
 Get to the Dark Elf city.
 Now, getting around the city is tricky.
 If you try to walk away from a room with a dark elf,
 you will be thrown out of the city.
 Same if you attack any of the dark elves.
 Refer to the below section ‘Navigating the Dark Elf City’
whenever you need to travel within it
 (until the goal is complete):
 .
—————————————————————–
Navigating the Dark Elf City:
 .
 Use slit/disintegrate/banishment/holy word
 on dark elf patrol guards to remove them.
 It’s okay if you fail the instakill, just kill them normally.
 The point is to get rid of them without getting transported.
 .
 Panic works to drive them out of the room,
 but it only makes them go into a neighbouring room.
 .
 Certain spells e.g. blind, dispel magic, charm
 can initiate combat without getting transported,
 You can use them on dark elf archers,
 then finish killing them to loot ‘a bolt and crossbow’
(if you didn’t get the crossbow earlier on).
 Strangle also works.
—————————————————————–
.
Walk to A Burned-Out Forge
 Type ‘look hearth’ (‘examine’ does not work, only ‘look’)
A fire elemental will appear, and
‘(G) a cheerful fire elemental’ will be added to your inventory.
 .
 run
 Look for a giant dynamite bat in the outer caves.
 Wear the ‘a bolt and crossbow’ you had obtained earlier on.
 (If you did not manage to get ‘a bolt and crossbow’ earlier,
 scroll back up to Navigating the Dark Elf City for details.)
 Be vis before killing the bat.
 .
 The giant dynamite bat expires shortly after you get it,
 so stack your commands such that as soon as you attack the bat,
 you run straight to The Birthing Chamber.
 This would involve a speedwalk to A Slippery Ledge (G),
 followed by squeeze through;run e4nen;open n;run nene
 to run to The Birthing Chambers.
 .
 Walk into The Birthing Chambers with all 5 items
 (including plans)
 Upon entering the room, leader should update tasks.
 .
 ** Task Done : Rescue the Dark Elves from the Cerejellums
 ** Task Added : Gather Twelve Dark Elf Weapons for the Priestesses
 .
 Remember to re-wear your normal weapon.
 .
 From The Birthing Chambers,
 run wsw2sw4sw;squeeze through;run se3sws2w;open n;n
 to Entering the City Proper.
 .
 Same as before in the dark elf city.
 Slit/disintegrate/banish the patrol guards
 (you can also strangle/sleep the patrol guards),
 strangle/blind/not-combat-spell the other dark elves.
 .
 Every time you kill a dark elf, you should see
 a yellow message mentioning a cerejellum sage,
 and the number of weapons left to collect.
 Keep killing dark elves until it’s
‘time to return to the cerejellum leader’.
 .
Get to Before the Gates (G), then
 run 2ene3nwn;squeeze through;run e4nen;open n;run nene
 to The Birthing Chambers.
 Upon entering the room, you should recieve a blazebomb
 and complete a task.
 .
 ** Task Done : Gather Twelve Dark Elf Weapons for the Priestesses
 .
 The blazebomb expires in a few minutes.
 To get another bomb, run back to The Birthing Chambers.
 Upon entering the room, you should recieve a blazebomb.
 .
 Before planting the bomb:
 Right after repop, kill all the dark elves in the city.
 Time it such that they won’t repop when
 you run in to plant the bomb.
 Sense life can help with this.
 .
 As before, use slit/distingrate/banishment/strangle/etc.
 Refer to previous section on Navigating the Dark Elf City for details.
 .
 With city dark elves dead, and at least a few min before repop,
 return to (room west of birthing chambers),
 run ewsws;open s;run 2sw4sw;squeeze through;
 run se3sws2w;open n;run 2nenws2wn;plant bomb
 to get to The Pulpit, and plant the bomb.
 .
 You will be transported to Approaching the City,
 and be told to find the high priestess.
 run 3ene to Twist in the Tunnels.
 Upon entering, she should ask you to nod to her.
‘nod high’ to get transported to In the Dark Lady’s Realm.
 Go north to complete the goal!
 .
 ** Task Done : Help the High Priestess
 ** Goal Completed: A Dark Elf Dilemma
 INFO: Player has earned the favor of the Dark Lady.
 .There is a post-goal Area Quest here.
 From starting room, run sese2se3sws2w;open n;n to Entering the City Proper.
 Walk around the city, killing dark elves for the Dark Lady’s amulet.
 You won’t get transported, since you completed the goal.
 The amulet has a rather low chance of spawning,
 so you have to kill a lot of dark elves. Keep going!
 Kill until you have 5 Dark Lady’s amulets.
 .
 Have all 5 amulets in your inventory (not bag).
 Return to the dark elf high priestess,
 then ‘nod high;north’ to return to the Dark Lady.
 Upon entering the room, she will take your 5 amulets
 and give you the Dark Lady’s blessing.
