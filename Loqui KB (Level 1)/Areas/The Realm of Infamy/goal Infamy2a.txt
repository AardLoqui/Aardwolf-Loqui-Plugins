 resourceful and she usually has the right idea about events going on in
 Infamy. However, in this particular case she is incorrect. Now, I am sure

 listen to my story before you pass judgment."

 weeks ago when I came across Cronus. He was partaking in an intimate
 conversation with Rok, their heads bowed over some papers and they were
 pointing this way and that way, yelling at each other and demanding the
 other listen. The end result was Rok getting so angry he bashed Cronus
 over the head with a rock and a brawl ensued."

 worse, they had scratched out his name and written in 'Watfish', so that
 they would appear to be my plans!"

Secret Tomb [**> PK <**]
  The tomb is filled with a large stone table, a crack running down the middle.
It is barren except for old papers, yellowed and cracking with age. Two 
shelves line the walls, dusty old bottles lining each one, cramped and dirty.
There is no light in the tomb, darkness encompassing every inch of space. A 
single candle has been left on a rickety old chair, the wax burned down low 
and the wick burned low.

[ Exits: south ]
     An old stone table takes up the majority of the room.
Rashyl arrives from the south.
   
Rashyl gets excited when she sees the table and the old potions.
She then begins picking up bottles and inspecting the labels.


     
Rashyl starts measuring and mixing various liquids. After a few
minutes steam begins to pour from one of the bottles. Rashyl
takes a cork and seals it. She walks over and puts the bottle
on the table. She scribbles a message on the old scroll, hands
it to you. She signs 'I will see you soon' and leaves.


     
The message reads:
Go back the way we came and enter the corpse, then toss the
elixir at Mordred. Our work here will be done and we can go home.

Mordred is looking pretty pissed off at you right about now.
Perhaps it is because he realizes you just foiled his master
plan to escape this place. Now would probably be a good time
to get out of here before he attacks you.
